ðŸ¤” Everything started just like a hobby.

I graduated as mechanical engineer with machine design specification, and started work like that at Pauger Carbon Ltd.

During my works I noticed the opportunity that I could automate my and others work to spare time and money, make the processes faster. So I started learn VBA for Excel and later Python from books, online videos and online courses. I learnt some HTML and CSS and to use Git. ðŸŒ±

I worked as process engineer on my second workplace at Musashi Hungary Manufacturing Ltd. where I could make a lot advantage on automations, because we had many data collected on an SQL server, but all the reports were made manually, so I automated reporting with Python, which was great and useful for everyone, because it sent report hourly about the production via email as well. I also made smaller applications to make our lifes easier, like file converters for measuring machines etc. Of course I write these programs after work in my free time first.

During these projects I noticed I like this and I want to work with programming. I tried other online courses and languages (Java, Kotlin for Android), but finally I ended up joining to a famous coding bootcamp Green Fox Academy. There I learnt first Java and a framework Spring for making webapplications. After I passed the exams in the project phase I learnt another language and framework C# and .Net Core.

After finishing the bootcamp I started work by evoCRM Ltd. where we are dealing with CRM implementation and development beside the consultancy, which fits to me due to process automations, too. I am continously working on widen my knowledge in the Microsoft world on the Power Platform, passing exams to prove with certifications.

My main path is the Dynamics 365 CRM and model-driven apps, but I also work with Power Automate cloud flows, Power Apps (canvas apps) and SharePoint as well.

Meanwhile I am learning and dealing with other stuffs as well, like Angular to build greater single page applications with .NET core backend like [sim-racing-is.fun](https://sim-racing-is.fun) site for Assetto Corsa fans or Arduino for home automation. I try to make some blog posts about some of these projects on this site to share knowledge and experience.

Thank you for reading through, if you have any questions or interesting topic just contact me ðŸ“«.

Cheers,

Gergely
