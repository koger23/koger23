# Welcome on my Github Page!

This GitHub page was created to collect my projects to a clean site meanwhile I can learn new things and practice coding.
The page is a SPA written with the help of Angular framework (v12). 

Since GitHub does not provide a backend or database for storing articles or posts, I am trying to solve this problem with markdown files and my public repositories. This is a quite easy and fast and good way to write new posts or just publish a new project using the README.md of the project.

Please feel free to navigate through my pages to discover more about the site or me on page "About" or just check my Projects.
